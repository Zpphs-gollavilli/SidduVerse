                    Hello! I’m <strong className="text-primary">G Siddharth</strong>, a passionate and energetic 7th-grade student at <em>Zilla Parishad High School, Gollavilli</em>. I believe in growing every day — not just in the classroom, but in everything I love: <strong>Badminton</strong>, <strong>Chess</strong>, <strong>Music</strong>, and <strong>Technology</strong>.

                    <span className="font-bold text-blue-700">🏸 Badminton – My Drive to Excel:</span>  
                    Badminton is my discipline, my thrill, and my escape. I train daily with passion, and I’ve proudly represented my school in state-level tournaments. My favorite move? The smash — fast, powerful, and just like how I chase my dreams!
                </p>

                    <span className="font-bold text-purple-700">♟️ Chess – My Mind’s Playground:</span>  
                    Chess sharpens my mind and teaches me strategy, focus, and planning. I love analyzing games, learning from every checkmate and blunder. I’ve competed at the district level and am always studying to improve my skills like a future grandmaster.

                    I’m deeply connected to Carnatic classical music. I practice Sarali Swaras, Jathiswarams, and even Varnams. Music fills my life with joy, emotion, and calmness amidst my other pursuits.
